        <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 2, 2025</p>

        <p>Pizza Factory Slise is committed to providing the best quality food and customer service. This policy outlines the terms for cancellation and refunds for orders placed on our website.</p>

        <h2>1. Order Cancellation</h2>
        <p>As our pizzas are made fresh to order, we can only accept cancellations within a short window after the order has been placed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An order can be cancelled within <strong>10 minutes</strong> of it being placed.</li>
            <li>To cancel your order, please call us immediately at +91 91827 14776 with your order details.</li>
            <li>Once an order is sent to the kitchen for preparation (typically after 10 minutes), it cannot be cancelled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Refunds will be processed in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Successful Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel your order within the 10-minute window, a full refund will be processed to your original method of payment within 5-7 business days.</li>
            <li><strong>Incorrect Order / Quality Issues:</strong> If you receive a wrong order or are not satisfied with the quality of the food, please contact us within 30 minutes of delivery with your order details and a photo of the item. We will, at our discretion, offer a replacement, store credit, or a partial/full refund. The decision of the management will be final.</li>
            <li><strong>Failed Delivery:</strong> If we are unable to deliver your order because of an incorrect address provided by you or if you are unavailable to receive the order, no refund will be issued.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Refund Process</h2>
        <p>All refunds will be credited to your original mode of payment. Please allow 5-7 business days for the refund to reflect in your account.</p>
